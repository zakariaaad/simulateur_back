### `MySQL configuration`
Please create database with name simulateur in Mysql<br>
You will find the database separatly from the folder Simulateur.sql<br>
i've created an example of environnement file called env.example to make the changes in database configuration with API .<br>
you have to import database in phpmyadmin<br>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install the dependencies inside `node_modules`

### `node server.js` OR `nodemon start` OR `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
